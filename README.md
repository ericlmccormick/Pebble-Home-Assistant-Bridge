# Home Assistant AI v1.0.0 — Pebble watch app (Bridge-only)

Home Assistant AI is a Pebble watch interface for Home Assistant Assist, powered by the **Home Assistant Bridge plugin**. All Home Assistant network traffic, credentials, agent selection, TTS generation and WAV conversion are handled by the Bridge. The app does not contain a built-in/direct Home Assistant connection.

## Required installation

1. Install and configure **[Home Assistant Bridge](https://github.com/ericlmccormick/Pebble-HA-plug-in)** v1.0.1 in the Pebble mobile app.
2. In **Bridge settings**, enter the Home Assistant HTTPS URL and long-lived token, choose the default conversation agent and TTS engine, and verify the connection.
3. Install **[Home Assistant AI](https://github.com/ericlmccormick/Pebble-Home-Assistant-Bridge)** v1.0.0. Allow its HomeConverse and InvokeAction plugin permissions.
4. Press **Select** to use PebbleOS dictation. Home Assistant's reply appears on the watch, with audio on Pebble watches that have speakers.
5. In app Settings, configure audio on/off, automatic dictation submission, font size, vibration and optional conversation reset. Server credentials and TTS engine selection are managed **only in the Bridge**, not in this app.

The long-press Select conversation mode uses **repeated system dictation**, not a continuous raw microphone stream; the Pebble plugin API does not yet expose an always-open, streamable microphone endpoint. The watch's speaker and audio codec remain native watch code imported from the shared SDK.

## Shared audio SDK

The app uses the versioned **[Bridge Audio SDK](https://github.com/ericlmccormick/Pebble-HA-plug-in/tree/main/sdk)**:

- `src/pkjs/ha_audio.js` — verified progressive WAV transfer, ADPCM encoding, next-sentence TTS prefetch and Bluetooth pacing.
- `src/c/ha_audio.c` — watch 16-KiB ADPCM ring buffer, dual PCM frames, speaker flow control and playback telemetry.
- `src/c/ha_audio.h` — the watch integration API.

The app's `src/pkjs/index.js` now contains only conversation UI, Bridge invocation, settings and SDK integration; it no longer duplicates the TTS decoder/transport. The watch's `src/c/main.c` delegates `AUDIO_*` messages to `ha_audio_handle_message()`.

This app vendors a tested snapshot of the three SDK source files. Future protocol changes should update **all three files together**, and regression-test the native app before release.

Install the Bridge first, configure your Home Assistant credentials and voice defaults in its settings, then install the watch app and authorize its plugin permissions. The app itself never stores a Home Assistant access token.

## Store screenshots

The [Store screenshots GitHub Actions workflow](https://github.com/ericlmccormick/Pebble-Home-Assistant-AI/actions/workflows/store-screenshots.yml) builds this app and captures its initial screen in the emulator for every compatible platform declared in `package.json`: Pebble Time (`basalt`, 144×168), Pebble Time Round (`chalk`, 180×180), Pebble 2 (`diorite`, 144×168), and Pebble Time 2 (`emery`, 200×228).

Open the workflow, choose **Run workflow** on `main`, then download the **home-assistant-ai-store-screenshots** artifact from a successful run. GitHub packages artifacts in ZIP files; extract the four native-resolution PNGs for the store. The workflow also runs automatically when watch source, resources, images, or the manifest change. Each emulator result is independently validated. Screenshots show the app's initial screen and do not require live Home Assistant service credentials.

## Migration from v0.2.x

v1.0.0 removes the built-in Home Assistant URL/token and direct connections. Earlier app-local direct credentials are deleted on launch, while conversation ID, text-to-speech enabled state, font size, haptics and dictation preferences are preserved. Configure credentials and voice defaults **in the Bridge settings** before running the new app.

For rollback, the previous implementation remains in older Git commits; installing an old PBW is not the recommended long-term method because it duplicates Home Assistant credentials and audio transport logic.
